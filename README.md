# Radar Schedules

Python implementations of Methods for Multi-function Phased Array Radar Beam Scheduling from various papers.

## Context

This started as some MATLAB code, and `all_methods_one_time.py` is an attempt to re-create this faithfully.

I'm slowly ripping everything out of that to make something a little easier to swap algorithms in and out of and to have repeatable runs.

## To run 8 scenarios

1. Run `generate_eight_scenarios.py`
1. Run `eight_scenarios.py`
